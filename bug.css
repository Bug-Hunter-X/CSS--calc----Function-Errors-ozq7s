The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but it can sometimes lead to unexpected results if not used carefully. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` might not work as expected if the parent container's width is not explicitly set, leading to inaccurate calculations.  Another common issue arises when combining units inconsistently. For instance, `calc(100px + 10%)` will cause errors.
